                  A SHORT NOTE FROM SAM GOLOB

I needed Jeff Broido's LAA command to work with SWA "above the line",
so I asked Jeff to fix it.  Jeff obliged.  Jeff thinks that a bunch
of his other commands also won't work with SWA above the line, but
he doesn't have a chance right now to fix this entire file.  I didn't
want to deprive all of you from at least using LAA, and seeing how
Jeff fixed it.  Therefore, I'm replacing LAA with the fixed version.
The rest of File 423 is unchanged.

                                  Sam Golob  -  July 9, 92.

Created PUTLINE version of LAA using Howard Dean, Jim Elsworth
technology from File 136.  Old versions still here.    Jan. 20, 2006.


P.S.  Macro IHAQDB comes from PVTMACS and is not licensed software.
      Now macro IHAQDB is in SYS1.MODGEN.  (z/OS 1.1x)

Additionally:  I've added several programs from Jeff to this file.
      DUMPV.......DUMP VARIABLES AND THEIR EVALUATIONS
                  IN CLISTS AND REXX EXECS
      FINDEM......GDG VOLSER DISPLAY PROGRAM (TSO COMMAND)
