//*           This is all Jeff Broido's stuff, but I made a few     *   FILE 423
//*           changes here and there, like PUTLINE-ing LAA and      *   FILE 423
//*           other programs which were coded with TPUT, etc.       *   FILE 423
//*           (Sam Golob), adding LISTHEAD, etc. which I found      *   FILE 423
//*           among Jeff's later programs, and modifying it some.   *   FILE 423

//*           The ideas for the LISTMOD and LISTMODD programs       *   FILE 423
//*           came from Jeff Broido's LISTHEAD program, but all     *   FILE 423
