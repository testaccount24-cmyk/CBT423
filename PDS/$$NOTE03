Note about the LAA program.

Back in 1978, the macro IHAQDB was probably in PVTMACS and not in
SYS1.MODGEN.  So that is why Jeff Broido probably saw fit to include
it internally in the source.  Nowadays this macro is in SYS1.MODGEN.

So I removed the macro source from the LAA program source.  It gets
included from SYS1.MODGEN in the SYSLIB concatenation in the assembly.
