)F FUNCTION -

  The DIGCLK command takes control of your 3270 terminal
  and uses it as a digital clock.

)X SYNTAX -

         DIGCLK

)O OPERAND - NONE
  REQUIRED - NONE
  DEFAULTS - NONE
  Note -     To exit the digital clock, you have to reset
             the screen and then press PA1 (attention).
             You will then be prompted to press enter or
             end.  To get out, you have to type the letter
             E.

  Note2 -    The way this command is currently coded, you
             have to hard-code the difference between
             Greenwich Time (or UTC) and your current time
             zone.  See global settings at the beginning of
             the program.

             If your region switches to Daylight Savings
             time twice a year, it may be best to assemble
             two versions of this program, one for the
             Standard Time, and one for the Daylight Savings
             time, and rename the two versions as appropriate.

  Note3 -    Setting the time zones before assembly.

                      SET THE TIME ZONE HERE
                      --- --- ---- ---- ----
    As this command is currently coded, you will have to adjust for
    the current time zone and re-assemble this command.  The adjust-
    ments are coded using the settings below....

    A.  First adjust &PLUSMIN if you are east or west of Greenwich.
        Set it to '-' if you are west.
        Set it to '+' if you are east.

    B.  Then adjust &DISPLHR to tell the program how many hours of
        displacement (already set to plus or minus).

    C.  If your time zone is not an even hour, plus or minus of
        Greenwich, then set the appropriate number of minutes to
        add, in &PLUSMIN.  &PLUSMIN will add only, not subtract.
        So you may have to adjust &PLUSMIN and &DISPLHR together,
        to get the actual correct displacement from UTC.
